            "The Mayo Clinic's recommendation for managing hypertension after liver transplant involves a multi-faceted approach that includes lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic interventions. According to the Liver Transplant Hypertension Treatment Guideline, the first-line treatment for hypertension in liver transplant patients is a calcium channel blocker, specifically the dihydropyridine class, such as amlodipine or nifedipine. However, it is essential to note that nifedipine may increase the concentration of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine), and therefore, increased trough monitoring is recommended.\n",
            "\n",
            "For patients with specific comorbidities, such as heart failure, active coronary artery disease (CAD), or diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or significant proteinuria, alternative first-line agents are recommended. For patients with heart failure, beta-blockers or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) are preferred, while beta-blockers are the drug of choice for patients with active CAD and recent coronary events. In patients with diabetes, CKD, or significant proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the preferred first-line agents, although they are not recommended in the immediate post-transplant phase.\n",
